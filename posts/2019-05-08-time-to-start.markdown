# Time to start working

I could do a quck spiel about who I am or what I do but, really, that's supposed to go on the [home page](https://yev.bar) so, in that case, I'll just lay out what I'm hoping to get out of this:

1) Improve my writing ability - I'm about to go finish high school as of writing this and, frankly, my writing ability has only degraded over the past few years and may even be part of the reason for my college admission results (to be linked later). There are many reports of people who claim that starting a blog or at least writing more frequently has helped them improve their writing ability overall so, following this thought, I'm going to be more proactive with my content on this site.

2) Start making and finishing projects - I've been to well over 25 hackathons at this point and, in all honesty, I don't have a single thing to show for it other than the number 25. I may have some projects on my GitHub profile but, if they're still there, they haven't been touched since the weekend I created them. If I put out a public statement (i.e. in a post on this site), I feel that it will incentivize me to make more progress toward it and perhaps even complete a few things

3) Store information/knowledge in an organized manner rather than all by memory - the description outlines it fairly well. I scroll through [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs), Twitter, and sometimes even Pocket every day. As a result of all this, I get a large influx of really interesting things however, they provide a spark of enjoyment in the moment before being forgotten and I get no feasible long term benefit as a result of it. My eventual goal is to provide a sturdy information storage/retrieval system so that people may enjoy the same supply of knowledge I do

This post is very much a work in progress but I feel that at least starting it is a step in the right direction for me
