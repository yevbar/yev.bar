        <h1 id="sleep">Sleep</h1>
<p>As of June 4th, I was no longer a high school student. Now that I’m graduated, I can work full time at my current job (Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://launchdarkly.com">LaunchDarkly</a>). And, also as a consequence of graduating from high school, I can control my daily schedule!</p>
<h2 id="initial-experiment">Initial experiment</h2>
<p>Over the past few days, I’ve attempted a 24-hour based schedule where every day has the same template which would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>06:00 - Wake up
06:15 - Go out for jog
06:45 - Finish jog / Come home
06:50 - Shower + Brush teeth
07:00 - Dry hair + Prepare bag for work
07:10 - INSERT
08:00 - Leave for work
09:00 - Arrive at work
17:00 - Finish work + Head home
18:00 - Arrive home
18:15 - INSERT
22:00 - Go to sleep</code></pre>
<p>The <code>INSERT</code> blocks are large blocks of time that I can actually fill up (with chores, projects, lecture/video watching, etc). On the days that this follows through, I was in a strong state of flow throughout the entire day and generally felt as though I was productive.</p>
<p>One of the primary goals for having this layout is that, whether I was on the train headed someplace or sitting at my desk at work, I did not want to have any conscious entropy about the idea of “What will I be doing next?”. Basically, I didn’t want to worry about a day ending up unproductive because I didn’t plan out my proceeding steps. This was not a worry with the above template.</p>
<p>However, one of the big pitfalls/downsides of this approach is <strong>sleep</strong>. Specifically, there were two worrisome states:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Going to sleep at 10:00 PM when I feel as though as I could be awake <strong>and</strong> productive for couple more hours. Even worse is when I spend 1-2 hours effecitvely twiddling my thumbs waiting to even get tired.</p></li>
<li><p>Waking up at 6:00 AM and having a difficulty getting out of the bed. The question being why bother getting up this early when the only thing I <em>really</em> need to do is go to work.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And, so, three ideas emerge</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Getting 8 hours is a standard and healthy number for hours of sleep per night but, perhaps, that number doesn’t need to be hit <em>every night</em>. Reviewing point #2 from above, I am likely to always hit a motivational wall every morning unless I am waking up naturally. Perhaps a 48 hour template where I get 8/6/8/6 hours of sleep per night would allow for me to obtain those additional hours of work in the evening.</p></li>
<li><p>Forget the morning jog, go for something around lunch time and wake up closer to when I need to leave the house.</p></li>
<li><p>Jog/exercise later in the day so, by the time I need to sleep, I’m feeling a lot more tired/ready to sleep</p></li>
<li><p>Polyphasic sleep - Bit more extreme than the 8/6/8/6 sleep schedule mentioned in #1 but how about something that involves napping for 4 hours in every 16 hour block</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>8:00 AM Wake up + Leave house
9:00 AM Arrive at work
5:00 PM Finish workday
6:00 PM Arrive at home
12:00 AM Nap
4:00 AM Wake up
8:00 AM Leave house
9:00 AM Arrive at work
5:00 PM Finish workday
6:00 PM Arrive at home
8:00 PM Nap
12:00 AM Wake up...
</code></pre>
<p>Or, maybe better, a popular polyphasic sleep schedule (can be discovered via word of mouth and/or Reddit)</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>I will likely be incorporating ideas 1, 2, and 3 (from the above list) and may explore 4 (polyphasic sleep schedule) some time later during the summer. Updated template to be recorded soon!</p>
